            We estimate the macroeconomic effects of defence expenditure using a novel dataset covering the universe of defence procurement contracts in Spain over 30 years. Our defence procurement data overcomes identification challenges posed by implementation lags inherent in traditional government spending, as contracts are awarded years before production begins and spending is recorded in government national accounts only upon delivery. Using local projections, we find that GDP effects take time to materialise, become sizeable, but remain transitory. That is, while defence investment has relevant economic consequences, these are bound to occur in the medium run insofar as the spending process is hindered by implementation lags. A DSGE model calibrated to our empirical setting yields two main findings. First, reducing implementation lags to US levels would meaningfully frontload macroeconomic effects. Second, defence spending delivers more transient and smaller long-run effects than general public investment projects.

            What is the economic impact of having established a common market in the European Union
(EU)? This paper aims to shed light on this fundamental question. It presents the main trends
in integration, reviews the existing literature, and summarises the various estimates of its
impacts as well as the potential gains of further integration. Economies within the Single Market
are more integrated than those outside it, and declining trade costs suggest increased fluidity
and reduced frictions within the Single Market, reinforcing its role in fostering integration. The
economic literature based on gravity models points to positive and sizeable impacts brought
about by the Single Market, albeit those are heterogeneous across estimation techniques and
countries. Overall, we can reasonably say that EU’s GDP is at least three to four percentage
points higher than it would have been without the Single Market, and this is likely to be an
underestimation of the gains, because they are based on “static” effects only. General
equilibrium models that aim to capture also dynamic effects suggest that the gains may well
be twice as large. Finally, the paper discusses the potential for further integration
